This Python code uses the saved information in ```AlbumData.xml``` to export an Apple iPhoto or Aperture library. It exports the projects into separate folders in format ```YYYY_mm_<Project_Name```.

To run, simply replace the path to your iPhoto library (including the iPhoto folder itself) and the export folder and run ```exportApertureLibrary.py```.

Should work on any OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). Only tested on Windows.
